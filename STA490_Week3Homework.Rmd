# Introduction: 


.left[


- Data Set was taken from 'Applied Analytics Through Case Studies Using SAS and R by Deepti Gupta'

- Data set consists of 3593 observations and 11 variables

- Variables are as follows:
   - 1) Carrier (Categorical) - The airline that the flight is taken with
   - 2) Airport_Distance (Numeric) - The Distance between the airports (in miles)
   - 3) Number_of_flights (Numeric) - Total number of flights in airport
   - 4) Weather (Numeric) - Delay due to weather condition ranked 0-10, with 0 being mild and 10 being extreme 
   - 5) Support_Crew_Available (Numeric) - Total number of support crew available
   - 6) Baggage_loading_time (Numeric) - Time (in minutes) for loading the baggage
  - 7) Late_Arrival_o (Numeric) - Time (in minutes) for late arriving aircraft of the same flight
  - 8) Cleaning_o (Numeric) - Time (in minutes) for aircraft cleaning
  - 9) Fueling_o (Numeric) - Time (in minutes) for aircraft fueling
  - 10) Security_o (Numeric) - Time (in minutes) for security checking
  - 11) Arr_Delay (Numeric) -  Flight arrival time (in minutes). This will be the dependent variable in the model

# Summary of Building the Final Model

.left[

- Fit the full model with Arr_Delay as the response and all other variables as predictors

- T-tests determined Cleaning_o, Fueling_o, Security_o were all insignificant (p > 0.05) and I decided to remove carrier (this created the reduced model, which analysis was done with)

- Diagnostics of the reduced model were checked, and the assumptions of normality and homoscedasticity (constant variances) were violated

- A box-cox transformation was applied to Arr_Delay  (Î» = 0.5) , fixing issues with normality and constant variances

- Comparing the goodness-of-fit measures of the full model, the reduced model, and the model with the transformation, the model with the transformation was chosen

# Bootstrapping (Part 1): Observations

.left[

- Bootstrapping: Resampling with replacement

- Because our sample size is big enough, bootstrapping is a good method to use

- Sampling Distributions of Coefficient Estimates are pictured 

- Red density curves represent the actual sampling distribution of the coefficients, while the blue density curves represent the sampling distribution created from bootstrapping

# Bootstrapping Part 1 (Continued)

- We can check how well the bootstrap did by summarizing the results and building a confidence interval

- The estimated parameters and the 95% confidence interval for the bootstrapped sampling distribution are pictured 

- All parameter estimates in the coefficient matrices match (within rounding)

- Now we will look at the residuals of our sample and resample

- Sampling distributions of coefficient estimates are pictured
Red density curves represent the actual sampling distribution of the coefficients, while the blue density curves represent the sampling distribution created from bootstrapping
